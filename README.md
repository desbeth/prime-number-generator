# primeNumberCalculator
 This is a project which I created after writing a research paper for MATH-099. There is a prime number generator, prime numbers saved up to 1,000,000, and a Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic getter.
Upon request, I can send the LaTeX source code or a PNG file of the actual final paper, but I do not wish to put out my full name on the paper.
